'Bamazon' is a CLI app that mimicks "amazon" and uses Javascript, Inquirer, Node.JS & MySQL. When the user starts the "app", they are shown all the products in the "store". The user is then prompoted to pick the product number and a quantity that they would like to purchase. Once the purchase is made, the user gets a summary. The product database is updated to reflect the new in-stock quantities. 

Under the "manager" mode, a manager can view all inventory, view "low inventory" (products with less than 5 items left), update the quatity of a product, and add a new product.
